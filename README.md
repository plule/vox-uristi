## How to

Ensure you have [Dwarf
Fortress](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/) and
[DFHack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2346660/DFHack__Dwarf_Fortress_Modding_Engine/)
installed.

Run Vox Uristi, and select the upper and lower bound to export. Only the zone
between these two altitudes will be included in the exported model. It works
best by selecting the surface area of your map.

Once exported, open the `.vox` file with [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/).

## Limitations

- Incompatible with the MagicaVoxel viewer: only part of the map is loaded
- Mist and flows are not included
- No item is included, only ground and constructions
